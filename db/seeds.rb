# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
require 'faker'



# 20.times do
#     Student.create(name: Faker::Name.name, age: rand(18..22), email: Faker::Internet.email, year: ["Freshman", "Sohpomore", "Junior", "Senior"].sample, major: ["English", "Math", "Accounting", "Physics", "Biology", "Finance", "Economics", "Chemistry", "Film Studies", "Fashion Design", "Anthropology", "History", "Art History", "Engineering", "Geography", "Philosophy", "Meteorology", "Social Work", "Political Science", "Music Education"].sample)
